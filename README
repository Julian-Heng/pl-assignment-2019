Report is ./report.pdf. To make report, run `./make_report.sh`, requires pandoc
and probably some latex packages

HOW TO RUN ASSIGNMENTS:

For directories that have makefiles, it is as simple as running `make` and
then going into the build directory and run the executable.

For directories that do not have makefiles, there exist a file called `cmdline`
that would demonstrate how to run the program. If the file `cmdline` does not
exist, then it implies that the source file is meant to be interpreted and has
a shebang at the start of the file, to which just invoke it like a shell
script.

If it is appropriate, there exist a shell script called `test.sh`. This is to
verify if the program is functioning as intended.

If it is appropriate, there also exist a file called `input`. For all intents
and purpose, the point of the input file is to be piped into the program as
stdin. As such, you'd call the program like `./build/executable < input`.

So to summarise:

    1. If directory has Makefile, run `make` to build and `make test` to run tests
    2. If directory has no Makefile, but has a `test.sh`, execute `test.sh`
    3. Else, read `cmdline` or run the source file directly
